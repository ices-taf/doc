# TAF User Guidelines

## Introduction

### Aim

The Transparent Assessment Framework (TAF) is a framework to organize data,
methods, and results used in ICES assessments, so they are easy to find and
rerun later with new data.

It will provide an online archive of final assessment for each year, for all
stock categories. All data input and outputs are linked to existing or upcoming
ICES data services.
