# Scrum artifacts

## Product vision

It is very useful for this to be restated at the start of every scrum planning cycle.

## Definition of done

What it takes for a product backlog item to be complete and is accepted by the product owner. 
For example in coding jobs can be: well commented, has tests written for it, passes tests, and documentation updated.

See [here](planning/Definition_of_done.md) for the TAF projects definition of done.

## Product backlog

Is a list of items which are small but nonetheless composed of several tasks.  It is a big list of items, 
ordered so that the most important / relevant are at the top, as in a triage list.  It is continually under revision
and as items move up the list they may be split into smaller items to ensure they are:

* Independent
* Negotiable
* Valuable
* __Estimated__
* Small
* Testable

by the time the get to the top of the list and are ready to be selected as a sprint backlog item.

## Sprint backlog

The main 'task board'  Columns 2 - 5 of  the [sprint board](https://github.com/ices-taf/doc/projects/6).
These columns contain the tasks required to complete the product backlog items selected for that sprint so that 
they meet the [definition of done](planning/Definition_of_done.md).  The tasks should be made to take a fixed amount
of time, such as one day.

## Increment

The sum of all the **product backlog items** that meet the [definition of done](planning/Definition_of_done.md) 
by the end of the sprint.  The dev team will present this at the sprint review meeting and the product owner 
will determine when to release it.
