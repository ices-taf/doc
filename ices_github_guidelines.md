# ICES GitHub Guidelines

ICES provides four GitHub areas to facilitate scientific collaboration in marine
research:

1. Expert Groups<br>
https://github.com/ices-eg

2. Tools under development<br>
https://github.com/ices-tools-dev

3. Tools maintained by ICES<br>
https://github.com/ices-tools-prod

4. Transparent Assessment Framework<br>
https://github.com/ices-taf

The code in these repositories can be browsed and downloaded. To apply for write
access to specific repositories, please send an email to github@ices.dk.

The distinction between tools-prod and tools-dev is that
github.com/**ices-tools-prod** contains software that is operational and
maintained by the ICES Secretariat, while github.com/**ices-tools-dev** contains
everything else (operational software maintained by scientists outside the
Secretariat, experimental projects, etc.)

***

The main guidelines for working in the ICES GitHub areas are:

- Users should provide their full name in their GitHub profile
  (https://github.com/settings/profile).

- Repositories should be kept under 1 GB and should mainly contain code and
  configuration files. Large datasets, images, and documents are better stored
  elsewhere.

- Expert Group chairs may recommend a certain GitHub workflow for that group.
