 _"Transparency and participation of an extended peer community are important aspects of Responsible Research and Innovation"_
 Quote from ICES ASC Data's Den
 
This section is a modification of Data's Den at the 2018 ASC: TAF pitch - https://github.com/ices-taf/doc/issues/197

As we have more time to play with we can add a bit more complexity.  Ideas are:
* Introduce a wrong coloured block?
* Make the pieces harder to find in the audience?


#### 2. Overview of topics - reproducible research, open data, peer review, quality control (30 mins)



#### 3. Interactive discussion with audience - experiences, challenges and solutions (30 mins)

Slide with topics - run this like an open session:
1. Introduce discussion topics
2. Open discussion with floor
3. Summarise

#### 4. Online TAF demo - webpage, functionality, input data, analysis, output tables/plots (20 mins)

Demonstrate via examples:

1. North Sea Spotted Ray (5 mins)

2. Fisheries overview maps (5 mins)

3. RStox survey index calculation (5 mins)
